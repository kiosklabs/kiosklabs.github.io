        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Wely is a generalist developer, who works with several languages, particularly PHP, Python and Javascript.
        He is a former <a href="https://www.freelancer.com">Freelancer.com</a> software engineer, who led his team to increase the company's growth by refactoring and adding features to the email infrastructure. He also worked in parts of Freelancer.com such as the <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/community">Community</a> and <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/post-project">Project pages</a>. </p>

        <p>Before that, he worked as a Nodejs and Phonegap developer in <a href="http://eversun.ph/">Eversun / AoV</a>, while pursuing a degree in law at the University of San Agustin. He also worked freelance for a few years working with grad students developing software for their thesis. He has worked on a few projects <a href="https://www.upwork.com/u/welyjesch">online</a>. He is currently on a career break to relax and focus on learning new things (data science, machine learning, systems engineering) and working on new things (react native, amazon lambda, unity engine).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>
        During his time in Freelancer, Wely worked closely with data scientists to implement tracking features, which helped him develop a keen interest on machine learning and its applications. </p> <p>
        After finishing a  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"> Coursera Machine Learning course</a> sans certificate,
        he is now applying his knowledge by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/welyjs"> participating</a> in Kaggle competitions. He plans to work on building a portfolio on data science and machine learning while pursuing a nanodegree in Udacity in the near future.
